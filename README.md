## FAQ

#### Can you give me a real world example?

I'm using it to generate [dotenvx.com/llms.txt](https://dotenvx.com/llms.txt) with the following command:

```sh
npx -y llmstxt@latest gen https://example.com/sitemap.xml -ep "**/privacy**" -ep "**/terms**" -ep "**/blog/**" -ep "**/stats/**" -ep "**/support/**" -rt 's/\| dotenvx//' -t 'dotenvx' > llms.txt
```
